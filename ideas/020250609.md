“You cannot bend an Oak Tree”
you start with the saplings
and i weep
i don’t want to be left behind
i need the new system

i don't want to be reaching
for the heavens alone
i want to listen to the voices
of those around me
bring my ears closer to
their sweet music

if i cannot be bent
then turn me into a stump
i will give all I can

the arc of time
bends towards justice
maybe the tree of time
with all its branches
gives of itself towards
community towards Love

do not think this unnatural
do not think this a dark ending
giving might be inherent 
to humans from birth
