“You cannot bend an Oak Tree”  
you start with the saplings  
and I weep  
I don’t want to be left behind  
I need the new system

I don't want to be reaching  
for the heavens alone  
I want to listen to the voices  
of those around me  
bring my ears closer to  
their sweet music

if I cannot be bent  
then turn me into a stump  
I will give all I can

the arc of time  
bends towards justice  
maybe the tree of time  
with all its branches  
gives of itself towards  
community towards Love

do not think this unnatural  
do not think this a dark ending  
giving might be inherent  
to humans from birth
